// create function() dupNums 
// tempDup variable to hold number temporarily 
// and another variable with count of how many times it appears
// and loop through the array ( i = 0; i < num.length; i++) and compare num[i]
// if num[i] = num[i + 1]

// You'll need two higher-level variables to track the value that is currently appearing the most and how many times it is appearing.
// You'll need to compare every item in the array to every other item and count how many times they match.
// It's perfectly fine if your solution doesn't feel very optimized. We'll refactor later!

// create variable for most appearing value
// create variable for most appearing count

// loop over array (i)
//   start a counter for number of occurrences

//   loop over array again (j)
//     compare indexes
//       if same, increase counter

//   if counter > current most appearing count
//     update "most" variables to match

// return most appearing value and count
